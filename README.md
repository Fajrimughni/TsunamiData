Datasets contain records of 1000+ earthquakes from 1/1/2001 to 1/1/2023 from kaggle

This is the dataset and coding process, also the output for machine learning model for tsunami and earthquake data. The data show us about the properties of earthquake and tsunami when the event happens, and how to predict tsunami into the new dataset.
To summarize the output of machine learning model, I used the best of many of them are Support Vector Machine and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
